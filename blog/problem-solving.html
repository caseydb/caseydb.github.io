				<h2>Getting blocked on a simple problem</h2>
				<p>Early into this sprint I got stuck on a seemingly easy challenge. All I had to do was take this function:</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					function testSum(){<br />
					var expected = 7 <br />var actual = sum(5, 2) <br />if (actual != expected) <br />{ console.log("It's broken..") }<br />
					else { console.log("It works!") } <br />}
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>And write a “sum” function that would return “It works!” from the above function. The solution needed was:</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					function sum(a,b){<br />
					return (a+b); <br />} <br />testSum()
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Ultimately I needed to read different test solutions on stackoverflow and play around with it to solve it. I knew this
					was supposed to be easy, which didn’t make me feel good. I learnt that it is easy to overthink something. I had caught
					up in trying to pass an argument into testSum. Whereas testSum actually had all the inputs it needed. It simply needed
					to be returned.

				<h2>Elegant problem solving</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					During the Super FizzBuzz challenge I ran into the problem of trying to return an array with either a combination of
					correct strings plus numbers. I knew I needed a for loop but had forgotten how to write it. 10 seconds on google >
					stackoverflow and I had my one line for loop.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					It made truly realise Joseph’s point that you don’t need to remember all the syntax - you just need to know what you are
					trying to do and get good at searching for the answer.

				<h2>Some thoughts on problem solving techniques:</h2>
				<p>
					I feel grateful that I have been surrounded by people who have helped shape me towards gravitating towards a default
					growth mindset.

                    <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I feel confident with this but also think I have a long way to go. While helpful, I’m still not fluent in my problem solving 
                    skills which leaves me digging deep to write this. </p><br>

                    <p><strong>Just trying:</strong> This is my favourite go to. I really like to give it a nudge and see how far I can get. When I hit walls, I lean on successful 
                        examples and study them until I understand. I then try to recreate my first attempt with this new knowledge. </p><br>
                    
                    <p><strong> Messages:</strong> These are super helpful when it’s an error. The challenge I face is it’s often not an error, but rather being new to knowing 
                        the solution I need to implement. </p><br>
                    
                    <p><strong> logging:</strong> This is one of my best friends! Really helpful to be able to follow the code outputs as you go and make sure it is behaving 
                        as expected. Often it can identify where things are going wrong part way through a process. </p><br>
                    
                  <p>  <Strong>Google / Stack Overflow:</Strong> These are my two most common ways I troubleshoot a problem. It’s impressive how strong the online community 
                  is at helping each other. If you are stuck, chances are someone else was stuck too!</p>  <br>
