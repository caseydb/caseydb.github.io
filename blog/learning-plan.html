				<h2>Long term goals</h2>

				<p>
					My long term goals are to become a product led founder. Specifically, I’d like to be able to do full stack development
					within my startup, Amplifier. This will allow me to work alongside my developers to solve problems and build our product
					stronger and faster.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="plan-items">
				<h2>Strengths and limitations while learning</h2>
				<p>
					I have strength with my patience and positive attitude. I really do believe people are capable of achieving incredible
					things if they put their mind to it. Development is no different.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					My biggest weakness is that I’m stretched. I still work full time on my startup in addition to EDA. This will make for
					80+ hour weeks during bootcamp.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="plan-items">
				<h2>Human skills I want to develop through EDA</h2>
				<p>
					I’d like to strengthen my ability to detect when another person is struggling or thriving. This better empowers those
					around them, such as myself, to help them.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="plan-items">
				<h2>Managing the workload</h2>
				<p>
					To successfully manage the workload of EDA I need to honour time blocking. Having clear and scheduled times for
					development will give me the space to detach from other work and get my sprints done.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="plan-items">
				<h2>Bringing my whole Self for Bootcamp</h2>
				<p>
					Bootcamp will tough. It is going to have excitement but also pressure. It's important that I bring my whole self. This
					means being truly present. It means being open minded to new ways of doing things. It means leading with empathy in all
					my interactions. I need to consciously keep strong communication both for my interactions with other students but will
					on how I am coping technically and mentally. Bring it on!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="plan-items">
				<h2>Seeking help</h2>
				<p>
					Having the right process to solve problems is important. My first approach if I can’t debug it myself, is to ask Google
					and Stackoverflow. If no luck, I’ll ask the #foundations channel. As a last resort I will contact my facilitator
					directly.
