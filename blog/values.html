        <h2> Ethical Decision</h2>
<p>In 2018 I left my former job to start a digital marketing agency. By chance, a friend of mine was doing the same thing in Sydney, 
    so I flew over and we teamed up. We were 2 years into a friendship and very excited about the potential. </p> <br>
    <p>In the first week I
     learnt that he had been shoplifting from local markets. To make it worse, he had done it for a rush. Once confirmed, I made the decision to 
     part ways with him because it didn’t align with my values. I have no regrets as our integrity is everything.   </p>

<h2>Culture and Identity</h2>
<p>I grew up in Dunedin and New Plymouth. I whakapapa to Scotland, England, and Norway. I’ve built my identity around impact ventures.
     I truly believe startups can solve many of the world issues we face.  </p>

<h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
<p>My biggest strength is my optimism and positive attitude mixed with a deep caring for others. This has led my life's work to
     centre around bold ideas to help make the world a better place. </p><br>

   <p> My limitation is that with bold ideas, comes a big workload. It can be a real challenge balancing multiple commitments. I find 
    time blocking works wonders for helping with this. </p>
