            <h2> Why Neuroplasticity Matters</h2> 
<p>The principles of neuroplasticity suggest that the brain is malleable and constantly changing. One of the benefits of this is the 
    ability to rapidly improve at something by even thinking about the activity itself.  </p><br>


<p>An example of how I might engage with neuroplasticity throughout my learning with Enspiral Dev Academy could be actively reflecting on practice. 
    This could include writing functions in my mind and thinking about the way the arguments work together.</p><br>

    <p>Research suggests that you can increase your neuroplasticity by creating multiple connections to an idea. The thought process is that when you activate your 
        brain you fire up neurons to access this information. By having multiple connections to the idea, you increase the neurons that fire up and thus they cluster
         together to strong highway-like connections that deepen your understanding and ability to recall the information.</p><br>

<h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
<p>Growth mindset is the state of mind where you believe you can become awesome at something. This counters the fixed mindset where you can feel there are limitations that you 
    have no control over. Often through life you can land on false conclusions that you aren’t good enough at something. These doubts then result in action
     that reinforces the belief such as a lack of willingness to even try to improve. This is particularly relevant when studying to become a developer as 
     there are a number of challenges that are outside of your comfort zone. Approaching them with a growth mindset is important.  </p><br>

<p>To incorporate a growth mindset into my journey I am actively reflecting at the start and end of each day on the things that I feel I struggled with. I can then 
    consciously move myself into a positive mindset that with practice and persistence I can get really good at those areas. I’ve already experienced this with JS functions. 
    The great thing is that once you have a victory, you can use that a default example to give the growth mindset boost when you hit the next problem.</p><br>

<h2>Learning Plan Reflection</h2>
<p>I feel grateful that I have been surrounded by people who have helped shape me towards gravitating towards a default growth mindset. </p><br>
<p>It’s interesting when reflecting on my original learning plan. My original plan outlines the thought: “I have strength with my patience and positive attitude. 
    I really do believe people are capable of achieving incredible things if they put their mind to it. Development is no different.” The focus on that statement 
    is built through the lens of a growth mindset. It is important that I stay in touch with this learning plan and way of thinking as I move through the inevitable 
    growth opportunities ahead. </p> <br>
