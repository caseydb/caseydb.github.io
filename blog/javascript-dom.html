				<h2>The differences between HTML and CSS using an analogy</h2>
				<p>
					HTML is like the structure of a house and it’s contents. It looks after the core foundation of how things are joined
					together + the interior. For example the walls and furniture for the house, or for the HTML it would be the organisation
					and structure of headings and the content itself.
				</p>
			</div>
			<br />
			<p>
				CSS is like paint and decorations for the house. It is what brings it to life and makes it pleasant to take in. This could
				include the colors, fonts, and position.

				<h2>Control flow and loops</h2>
				<p>
					Control flow and loops allow control over the order things are done and how many times things may be done. For example,
					if every morning the first thing you do is wake up and walk the dog around 3 blocks, then make 1 cup of coffee - that is
					a control flow with a loop (repetitions) of 3 blocks and 1 coffee.
				</p>

				<h2>What the DOM is and how you can interact with it</h2>
				<p>
					Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in
					a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these
					characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially
					useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in
					the list.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="plan-items">
				<h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
				<p>
					To successfully manage the workload of EDA I need to honour time blocking. Having clear and scheduled times for
					development will give me the space to detach from other work and get my sprints done.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="plan-items">
				<h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h2>
				<p>
					A function is a set of statements, or instructions, that perform a task. You pass in information known as an argument,
					such as the number 10. You can then apply instructions such as multiple it by 5. You can then gain the result, otherwise
					known as returning it. In this case it would be 10x5 = 50.
