            <h2> Why Emotional Intelligence Matters</h2>
            <img id="block-image" src="https://blog.bonus.ly/hubfs/emotional-intelligence.jpg">
<p>When thinking about what intelligence means, it can be a natural reflex to think about intelligence quotient, or IQ. The reality though is that while that 
    is important, it is no more important than the more recently talked about emotional intelligence, or EQ. </p></div>
<div class="plan-items">
<p>EQ is the ability to be aware of, evaluate and control emotions. There seems to be mixed research on whether it can be learned and strengthened, or whether
     it is something you are born with. What is clear is that everyone has it, but not everyone practices the awareness and control of it.  </p><br>

<p>In nearly anything we do from life to family life, we interact with other people. Being able to look at things from their perspective and empathise with their
     needs, goes a long way in building relationships and increasing satisfaction in your pursuits be it personal or professional.</p>
</div>
<div class="plan-items">
<p>Having a high IQ is indeed attractive and helpful within your personal and professional life. However, having a high IQ is no guarantee of success. 
    How successful we are in life is determined by both emotional intelligence and by IQ, though intellect works best when itâ€™s accompanied by high emotional intelligence. </p>
</div>
<div class="plan-items">
<p>It feels good when you practice EQ through active listening. For example, during my listening and looping it was great to actually listen to what my
     listening and looping partner had to say. You end up leaving the conversation with a deeper relationship and having learnt more.</p>
