				<h2>Learnings about myself and my ego</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					First, I learnt that I do have a naturally positive attitude when things get tough, which I am grateful for. I don’t
					recall having any negative voices when I got stuck.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					Second, is that I do tend to take a lot of breaks when I get stuck. I think there were too many. It’s great to have
					breaks and recharge - but I think I started to go into the boundaries of breaks being a way to procrastinate from the
					task at hand.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					Finally, I had to keep my ego in check to not get help when needed. I stayed conscious of how it is okay, actually
					_important_, to google and get help when stuck. It’s okay to not know. Success is about being resourceful and getting to
					the desired outcome.

				<h2>Values, empathy, and self awareness when learning and programming</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					From a value perspective, I focused my learning outcomes to be around understanding what was happening, not rote
					learning syntax. This meant that within my values, it was okay to look at comparable code - as long as I rewrote it
					myself and could genuinely follow each step.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					This allowed me to have self awareness and empathy with the learning process itself. It allowed me to embrace challenges
					and try to pull the most learnings out of them.

				<h2>Core surprises and challenges</h2>
				<p>
					I was surprised how challenging it can be to write about yourself. It can take a few minutes to actually get in the zone
					and express what you honestly think about a topic. Once you get in a flow, it does get easier.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="plan-items">
				<h2>Why core is important</h2>
				<p>
					While careers in development itself may be centered around code - the reality is that it involves an equal amount, if
					not more, of working directly with people. This means that half your job actually comes down to your ability to interact
					with others. Combine that with the how core also helps you move into a growth mindset which makes learning so much
					easier and pleasant.
				</p>

			<div class="plan-items">
				<h2>Is core a waste of time that could have been spent coding?</h2>
				<p>
					Is core a waste of time that could have been spent coding? While I am indeed optimising for coding competencies, I
					absolutely value core. I’d say up until EDA, my primary skill set within my career as a community builder has been
					centred around core. As such I feel I have a good core base, but I still have a life of lessons ahead of me on core.
